# Description

This project includes a minimal Flask application and a diagram of a potential database structure.

- The movies_tools.py file defines a class Movie that accepts as constructor input one row of the movies_clean.csv file.
- The SI507_project2.py file allow user to go to the routes at the two paths.
- The '/ (home page)' display the number of movies recorded.
- The '/movies/ratings/' display a list of movies from the CSV data (6 movies actually...because there are too many.)
